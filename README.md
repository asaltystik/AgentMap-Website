Need to Rename this project since its no longer testing ideas,
but rather a full-fledged project.

Written in python, using the Django framework + HTMX. 

This is a Project for SecureCare65, a Medicare Supplement Broker, 
to help the call center agents to access relevant information faster.

ex. What Companies are available in this state? What Forms we have on file
for that company? What are the Household Discounts for that company? Am I 
Licensed in that State? What is the expiration date of my license?

Added in the ability to swap map layers, the options are { MS, DVH, HHC, Final Expense, Cancer },
this allows our agents to sell ancillary products just as easily as Medicare Supplements.

Still Experimental: Declinable Drugs Search
This will allow agents to search for a drug and get the brand/generic name and check if it is on any of our medicare
supplement carriers declinable list. This will help agents to know if that client will be declined for any prescriptions
they are currently taking. I need to figure out the generic/brand name for each drug and then add it to the database.
