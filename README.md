Need to Rename this project since its no longer testing ideas,
but rather a full-fledged project.

Written in python, using the Django framework + HTMX. 

This is a Project for SecureCare65, a Medicare Supplement Broker, 
to help the call center agents to access relevant information faster.

ex. What Companies are available in this state? What Forms we have on file
for that company? What are the Household Discounts for that company? Am I 
Licensed in that State? What is the expiration date of my license?
