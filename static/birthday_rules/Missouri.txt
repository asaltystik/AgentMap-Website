MO-Anniversary Rules

Individuals who terminate a Medicare supplement policy within 30 days of the annual policy anniversary
date may obtain the same plan with no health questions asked for a period of 63 days after the termination
of their existing policy, from any issuer that offers that plan.

The wording of the law is a bit confusing, pretty much ignore the 63 days part.
This would only come into play if someone has already cancelled a plan.
Stick to within 30 days of the anniversary

Use MedMutual for Anniversary applications.  Must also be effective within 30 days of anniversary.  Requires proof of paid to date if older than 2 years
Use American Home, Lifeshield or Cigna for UW.  Cigna pays less, so lean towards the first 2.
