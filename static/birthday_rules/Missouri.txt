MO-Anniversary Rules

Individuals who terminate a Medicare supplement policy within
30 days of the annual policy anniversary date may obtain the same
plan with no health questions asked for a period of 63 days after the
termination of their existing policy, from any issuer that offers that
plan.

The wording of the law is a bit confusing, pretty much ignore the 63 days part.
This would only come into play if someone has already cancelled a plan.
Stick to within 30 days of the anniversary

ACE, Cigna and Manhattan are the carriers to use for commission.
Cigna is only 7% on Plan F, 16% on Plan G and 20.5% on Plan N
MoO still pays but are not currently very competitive.
Manhattan will allow an application up to 60 days prior to anniversary date.
ACE requires proof of coverage AND paid to date
